# Data Leakage Prevention in Multi-Forecast-Hour Training

## Problem: Data Leakage in Multi-Forecast-Hour Scenarios

When training on multiple forecast hours (e.g., f024, f048, f072), the same URMA verification time can appear in different train/val/test splits, causing **data leakage** and artificially inflated performance metrics.

### Example of the Problem:
```
URMA verification time: 2023-01-15 12:00 UTC

Data points that could appear:
- f024 forecast from 2023-01-14 12:00 ‚Üí valid 2023-01-15 12:00 
- f048 forecast from 2023-01-13 12:00 ‚Üí valid 2023-01-15 12:00
- f072 forecast from 2023-01-12 12:00 ‚Üí valid 2023-01-15 12:00

‚ùå Old method: Could put f024 in train, f048 in val, f072 in test
‚úÖ New method: All three go in same split (based on verification time)
```

## Solution: Verification-Time-Based Splitting

### Key Changes:

1. **Split by URMA Verification Time**: Use `urma_valid_datetime` instead of forecast `valid_datetime`
2. **Prevent Cross-Split Contamination**: Same verification observation never appears in multiple splits
3. **Integrity Verification**: Automatic checking for data leakage

### Implementation:

```python
def create_time_splits(X, y, test_size=0.2, val_size=0.1):
    # Split by URMA verification times (the target observation times)
    unique_urma_dates = X.index.get_level_values('urma_valid_datetime').unique().sort_values()
    
    # Create time-based splits using URMA times
    train_urma_dates = unique_urma_dates[:val_start_idx]
    val_urma_dates = unique_urma_dates[val_start_idx:test_start_idx] 
    test_urma_dates = unique_urma_dates[test_start_idx:]
    
    # Create masks based on URMA verification times
    train_mask = X.index.get_level_values('urma_valid_datetime').isin(train_urma_dates)
    # ... etc
```

### Verification Output:
```
=== DATA SPLIT INTEGRITY VERIFICATION ===
Unique verification times:
  Train: 1825 unique times
  Val:   456 unique times  
  Test:  456 unique times
‚úÖ Train/Val: No overlap
‚úÖ Train/Test: No overlap
‚úÖ Val/Test: No overlap

üéØ DATA INTEGRITY VERIFIED: No data leakage detected!
   Multiple forecast hours are properly isolated by verification time.
```

## Benefits:

1. **Scientific Validity**: True out-of-sample testing
2. **Honest Metrics**: Performance reflects real-world capability
3. **Proper Model Selection**: Choose models based on valid performance
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets ML best practices for time series

## Impact on Results:

- **Before**: Artificially high scores due to data leakage
- **After**: More realistic (likely lower) but trustworthy scores
- **Model Ranking**: May change - some models handle multi-forecast-hour better than others

## Multi-Forecast-Hour Strategy:

The new splitting ensures that when using multiple forecast hours:
- Models learn from completely independent verification times
- Test performance reflects true operational capability
- No "peeking" into future verification observations

This is critical for operational forecasting where you need honest assessments of model performance across different forecast lead times.
